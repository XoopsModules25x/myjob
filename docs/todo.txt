TO DO (original by Hervet)
===========================

- Add the possibility to have an image by business (and why not by geography)
- FOAF
- CSV export: same (it gives me the idea of a statistical index page on the entire base, including obsolete: the most demanded areas, offered more sectors, the most popular regions, most proposed regions, number of hits, etc ...)
- Headers clickable to sort columns (in lists)
- Possible Filtering of visual lists
- Page comparison of several offers and / or claims with a shopping cart system as on e-commerce sites
